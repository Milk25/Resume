    <p>Welcome to my professioinal web resume.</p>
    <p>Here is a brief introduction about myself.</p>
    <p>This is Amilcar Cornier a self-taught developer who has learned HTML5, CSS3, Python, C#, and JavaScript from reading books.
        I've been trying to learn these concepts. 
        I've been to and in time learning to code from Coding Temple. Which in term teaches Python and JavaScript. 
        This school has given me the knowledge to learn Object Oriented Programming and its overall
        fundamentals. Furthermore am enrolled at Programmers Coach which teaches C#.
    </p>

    <p>My abilities in software development is a junior developer. My approach to this lifelong journey, is waking up in the 
        morning everyday and doing coding and tutorials in HTML5, CSS3, Python, C#, and JavaScript. I have my Bachelors in Science in 
        Computers in no time. When it comes to technology I love all that it is to it. I would love to get a job or 
        position in this field. I have the knowledge and know how in computer software development. Love reading books in 
        development and attending Colorado Technical University Online. I started July 4 of 2017 is this endeavor and going 
        to graduate in 2025. I also have the ability to learn quickly and giving one hundred percent.
    </p>     
    <p>I've been working harder at my intended goal. Which is to get employment as a software developer. I just recently
        started doing Javascript and Python at Coding Temple. A great school in-deed. My intentions is to get great at this! Employment
        job search has been difficult. Coding temple has given me the key to finding that position I need. Meanwhile, I have been studying Javascript
        and Python along and surely gotten better. Can one day come when I get employment. The answer to that lies in me. For surely
        getting and applying for a tech job will make me, but I intend to find a role. Everyday I respond to Indeed to make sure I open
        doors. Persistent and motivation is the way. I will graduate Coding Temple
        on September 2024.
